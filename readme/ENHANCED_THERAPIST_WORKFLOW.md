# Intelligent Therapy Booking with Selective Escalation & Confirmation

## 🎯 Overview
The therapy booking application uses **intelligent escalation** - handling most client inquiries independently while escalating only when professional judgment is needed. When escalation occurs, a **mandatory confirmation workflow** ensures Dr. Smith reviews and approves every response before it reaches the client.

## 🔄 Intelligent Workflow

### 1. **Smart Client Inquiry Processing**
- Client sends message via WhatsApp to agent (+97451334514)
- ADK agent intelligently analyzes request type and complexity

#### **🟢 HANDLE INDEPENDENTLY** (No escalation - immediate response):
- Standard appointment booking, cancellation, rescheduling
- Availability checks and scheduling
- General therapy center information 
- Service type explanations (in-call vs out-call)
- Appointment confirmations and reminders

#### **🔴 ESCALATE TO DR. SMITH** (Requires professional judgment):
- Medical/clinical questions about conditions or treatments
- Complex therapeutic concerns requiring expertise  
- Crisis situations or urgent mental health matters
- Special accommodation requests needing clinical approval
- Questions outside standard booking scope

### 2. **Enhanced Escalation to Therapist**
When escalation is needed, the agent:
- **Gathers Context**: Retrieves client history, recent appointments, and relevant background
- **Structures Questions**: Provides specific clarification questions based on escalation type
- **Formats Notification**: Creates comprehensive therapist notification with all necessary context

**Escalation Types:**
- `medical_clarification` - Medical/therapeutic scope questions
- `complex_request` - Multi-faceted or unusual requests  
- `urgent_matter` - Time-sensitive issues requiring immediate attention
- `special_accommodation` - Accessibility or special needs requests

### 3. **Therapist Notification Format**
```
🔔 CLIENT ESCALATION - [REASON]

👤 Client: [Name] ([Phone])
📅 Escalated: [Date/Time]

💬 Client Message:
"[Original message]"

🗓️ Current Appointment: [If applicable]

📋 Recent Appointments:
  • [Recent appointment history]

❓ Please clarify:
  • [Structured questions based on escalation type]
  • [Specific guidance needed]
  • [Recommended approach options]

📱 Please reply with your recommendation and I'll respond to the client accordingly.
🔄 Use format: RECOMMENDATION: [your guidance here]
```

### 4. **Therapist Response Processing**
- System detects messages from therapist (+97471669569)
- Automatically identifies recommendation content (keywords: "RECOMMENDATION:", "recommend", "suggest", "advise")
- Extracts client phone number from therapist message
- Processes recommendation through `process_therapist_recommendation` function

### 5. **Professional Client Response Preparation**
The system formats the therapist's guidance into a professional client message and **requests final confirmation**:

```
📋 FINAL CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

👤 Client: [Client Name] ([Phone])
📅 Response prepared: [Date/Time]

💬 Prepared Response to Client:
"Hello [Client Name],

Thank you for your patience. Dr. Smith has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following guidance:

[Therapist's recommendation formatted professionally]

If you have any follow-up questions or would like to schedule an appointment based on this recommendation, please let me know. I'm here to help you with your therapeutic care needs.

Best regards,
Wellness Therapy Center"

✅ Please confirm:
Reply "APPROVE" to send this response to the client
Reply "REVISE: [your changes]" to modify the response
Reply "DECLINE" to cancel sending this response

⏰ Awaiting your confirmation...
```

### 6. **Final Confirmation Processing** 
Therapist responds with one of three options:

#### **🟢 APPROVE**
- System sends prepared response to client immediately
- Therapist receives: "✅ CONFIRMED: Response sent to [Client Name]"

#### **🟡 REVISE: [new guidance]** 
- System creates new response with therapist's revised guidance
- Sends updated response to client
- Therapist receives: "✅ REVISED: Updated response sent to [Client Name]"

#### **🔴 DECLINE**
- System sends alternative consultation scheduling message to client
- Therapist receives: "❌ DECLINED: Alternative consultation message sent"

### 7. **Complete Tracking & Confirmation**
- **NO client responses sent without therapist approval**
- Complete audit trail of all confirmations
- Delivery confirmations back to therapist
- System tracks all escalations and approvals
