        [InlineKeyboardButton("✅ Confirm", callback_data=f"confirm_{appointment.id}")],
        [InlineKeyboardButton("🔄 Reschedule", callback_data=f"reschedule_{appointment.id}")],
        [InlineKeyboardButton("❌ Cancel", callback_data=f"cancel_{appointment.id}")]
    ]
    
    await bot.send_photo(
        chat_id=chat_id,
        photo="appointment_card.jpg",  # Custom appointment card image
        caption=f"""
🩺 *Appointment Confirmed*

📅 Date: {appointment.date}
⏰ Time: {appointment.time}
👨‍⚕️ Doctor: Dr. Smith
📍 Location: [Clinic Address](https://maps.google.com/...)

*What would you like to do?*
        """,
        parse_mode='Markdown',
        reply_markup=InlineKeyboardMarkup(keyboard)
    )
```

### **Email Rich Notifications:**
```python
# HIPAA compliant + rich HTML + attachments
from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail, Attachment

def send_appointment_confirmation(email, appointment):
    message = Mail(
        from_email='appointments@therapycenter.com',
        to_emails=email,
        subject='🩺 Appointment Confirmed - Therapy Center'
    )
    
    # Rich HTML with embedded images and links
    message.template_id = 'therapy_appointment_template'
    message.dynamic_template_data = {
        'client_name': appointment.client_name,
        'date': appointment.date,
        'time': appointment.time,
        'therapist': 'Dr. Sarah Smith',
        'location_link': 'https://maps.google.com/...',
        'reschedule_link': 'https://booking.therapycenter.com/reschedule',
        'intake_form': 'https://forms.therapycenter.com/intake'
    }
    
    # Add intake form PDF
    with open('intake_form.pdf', 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
    attachment = Attachment(
        file_content=base64.b64encode(data).decode(),
        file_type='application/pdf',
        file_name='intake_form.pdf'
    )
    message.attachment = attachment
```

## 🎯 **Final Recommendation**

**For your therapy booking system, I recommend this progression:**

1. **Start Safe** - Web demo + Email (rich HTML, attachments, links)
2. **Add Engagement** - Telegram bot (free, full multimedia, no risks)  
3. **Test Premium** - ChatAPI trial (realistic WhatsApp experience)
4. **Scale Smart** - Multi-platform based on client feedback

This gives you full multimedia support, link sharing, and bidirectional communication while minimizing risks and costs.
